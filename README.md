# Data Science Engineering Exercise

## Dataset

This exercise uses the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle.
The zipped dataset is included in the repo.

## Description of files

In this repo, you will find the following files:

* `heart-disease-uci.zip` The dataset. Unzip to get the file `heart.csv`.
* `Heart Model.ipynb` IPython notebook which contains the data analysis, model training, and model testing.
* `final_model.pkl` Saved copy of the final model.

## Packages Used

This project has been tested on Python 3.5. It uses the packages:

* `pandas` For data loading
* `sklearn` For model training

## Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to take an IPython/Jupyter notebook produced during an experiment by a data scientist and transfer it into a production code.
The notebook contains some analysis, logic to train a new model, and finally a test of that model.
Not all of this code needs to go into the production.

### Requirements

* The code should be runnable from any environment, e.g. a local machine or AWS.
* The user should be able to train a new model with a new dataset.
* The user should be able to use a trained model to make predictions.
* The code should be thoroughly tested with decent code coverage.

You are not expected to _deploy_ an app for this exercise, only to produce the code for this app.

Your solution will be evaluated by how well the requirements are met, cleanliness of code, and ease of use.

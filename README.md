# Heart Dataset Exercise

This exercise uses the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle.
The zipped dataset is included in the repo.

In this repo, you will find the following files:

* `heart-disease-uci.zip` The dataset.
* `Heart Model.ipynb` IPython notebook which contains the data analysis and model training.
* `final_model.pkl` Saved copy of the final model.

## Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to take a IPython/Jupyter notebook produced during an experiment by a data scientist and transfer it into a production code.
The notebook contains some analysis, logic to train a new model, and finally a test of that model.
Not all of this code needs to go into the production.

### Requirements

 * The code should be runnanble from any environment, e.g. a local machine or AWS.
 * The user should be able to train a new model with a new dataset.
 * The user should be able to use a trained model to make predictions.
 * The code should be throughly tested with decent code coverage.
